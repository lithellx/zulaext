## About ZulaExt

External ESP and Aimbot project for Zula.<br>
Made just for fun. You can do whatever you want with it.

## Before loading the driver:
1. Make sure you deactivated Windows Defender Real Time Protection, Riot Vanguard, Faceit Anticheat etc.<br>
2. (Only for Windows 11) Turn off "Core Isolation" and "Vulnerable Driver Blocklist" options on Windows security settings.<br>
And restart your PC afterwards.

NOTE: XorMapper will not map the driver on 24H2. You need to find another mapper.<br><br>
1. Load zulaext_drv.sys with XorMapper (get it from my Discord server) or any other mapper.<br>
2. Run the game <b>AS WINDOWED OR WINDOWED FULLSCREEN</b> and wait until the main screen.<br>
3. Run zulaext.exe as administrator on lobby.<br>
4. Press "Insert" key on your keyboard and have fun.
